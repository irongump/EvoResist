    * Absolute path "/^$/d" in line 377:
      Do not define absolute paths inside of the workflow, since this renders
      your workflow irreproducible on other machines. Use path relative to the
      working directory instead, or make the path configurable via a config
      file.

Lints for rule snp_calling (line 57, /home/runner/work/EvoResist/EvoResist/Snakefile):
    * No log directive defined:
      Without a log directive, all output will be printed to the terminal. In
      distributed environments, this means that errors are harder to discover.
      In local environments, output of concurrent jobs will be mixed and become
      unreadable.
      Also see:
      https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/rules.html#log-files
    * Specify a conda environment or container for each rule.:
      This way, the used software for each specific step is documented, and the
      workflow can be executed on any machine without prerequisites.

    * Param snv_dir is a prefix of input or output file but hardcoded:
      If this is meant to represent a file path prefix, it will fail when
      running workflow in environments without a shared filesystem. Instead,
      provide a function that infers the appropriate prefix from the input or
      output file, e.g.: lambda w, input: os.path.splitext(input[0])[0]
